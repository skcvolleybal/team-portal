# TeamPortal

## Description:

TeamPortal supports the Team Task Coordinator of SKC (TeamTakenCo, bestuur) in making schedules for match days. SKC members are scheduled on match days to be emergency responders, referees, scorers, or for setting up and dismantling the hall. To ensure that members are available, members can log in to TeamPortal to provide their availability.

The schedules are sent to relevant people weekly via a Cron job.

TeamPortal uses the Nevobo RSS feed to retrieve matches relevant to SKC. Furthermore, it uses the internal WordPress database of the SKC website to link teams and members.

## Requirements:
- PHP 8.1
- Node.js v18

# Pre-installation:
This readme assumes you have set-up your webserver software and WordPress + SKC specific database. If you haven't done this yet, go to: https://github.com/skcvolleybal/starthier 

## Required: 
1. Install Node.js v18: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Composer: https://getcomposer.org/download/. Use Laragons PHP version, likely installed in C:\laragon\bin\php\php-8.1.x-Win32-vs16-x64
3. Clone the team-portal repository in the root of your webserver in a team-portal directory, likely C:\laragon\www\team-portal. 

## Database
4. Create a new database for Team-Portal using [PhpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin) (or similar application such as DBeaver)
5. In the database, create the Team-Portal tables. Copy the SQL commands as found in team-portal\php\create_tables.sql and paste and execute them in PHPMyAdmin.
6. The database should now have the following tables: barcie_days, barcie_availability, barcie_schedule_map, teamportal_aanwezigheden, teamportal_email, teamportal_fluitbeschikbaarheid, teamportal_wedstrijden, teamportal_zaalwacht

## Angular
4. Navigate to the cloned repository directory. Likely C:\laragon\www\team-portal. Run `npm i` to install all required Angular packages.
5. Next, run `ng serve` (or `npm run ng serve`) to run the Angular service. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your webbrowser to view the app.
  
As long as `ng serve` is running, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## PHP
7. Navigate to the team-portal\php directory
8. Duplicate .env.example and call it .env 
9. Open .env and ensure the following:
 - Set ACCESSCONTROLALLOWORIGIN to http://localhost:4200
 - Set the DBHOSTNAME ("localhost"), DBNAME (the database you created earlier), DBUSERNAME and DBPASSWORD. This connects Team-Portal to its database. 
 - Set the WORDPRESS_PATH to where WordPress is installed, which should be your webservers root directory (C:\laragon\www). This ensures that Team-Portal can use WordPress' authentication classes. 
 - Set the WPDBHOSTNAME, WPDBNAME, WPDBUSERNAME, DBPASSWORD the same as your WordPress configuration. If you don't remember those, look at C:\laragon\www\wp-config.php.

10. Run `composer install` to install all required PHP packages. 

Troubleshooting: if things aren't working, assuming Angular has compiled and been set up properly, step through the PHP code using XDebug to find out the problem.
